Multiplayer? Online?
* Two/Three players collaborate.
  * Challenge is to work together with no communication
  * Could be "warioware" style aka short, successive games.
    * Different people each time? Maybe option to stick together?
* Maybe draw with moude like http://www.addictinggames.com/strategy-games/drawplay.jsp



Possible Competitive Game Modes
* Two goals, each try to push the single hero in (could be good and evil)
* Two goals, each tries to push their hero in. WHite hero blocked by black tiles, black hero blocked by white
Possible Cooperative Game Modes
* Each player is blocked by their own color
Possible Single Player Game Modes
*"centipede": the destroyer follows the creator. The number of tiles between them can be changed
*Limited by time
*Limited by amount painted
  *Can choose to paint
*Hidden parts? Only revealed when closer

Possible behaviors of "hero" - there should be a nice way to code this
* gravity (axis, strength, direction)
* initial velocity (direction, strength)
* bounciness
* friction
* moves every once in a while (jumps, scoots, etc)
* scale (larger/smaller)

Possible behaviors of levels
* timed
* gravity (property of hero)
* blocks are solid for creator/destroyer

Possible features to add
* "MOnsters" push the hero around or reset level on contact
* indestructible, impassible blocks
  * also ones that the hero can pass but creator/destroyer cant and vice versa
* Level select screen
* Falling damage for hero? aka splat if moving too fast
* resizable windows
* only destryer interacts

Level ideas
*empty pit, no creator, destroyer has to "bounce" hero across

Bits to improve/fix
* need to destroy onscreen objects upon level switch?
* paste last tile?
* move one tile per button press?
